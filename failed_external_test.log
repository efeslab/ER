Failing Tests (8):
    KLEE :: Feature/DeterministicSwitch.c
	  # root cause locates in Executor.cpp -> Instruction::Switch
	  # upstream use bbOrder to determine the ordering of successor BasicBlocks
	  # bbOrder is determined by an iteration of expressionOrder (a std::map)
	  # While my approach is to use successorIndex API from LLVM to determine
	  # the order.
	  # It is hard to make two approaches have the same ordering. And I do not
	  # think upstream's ordering make sence neither. So it is a WONTFIX for now.
    KLEE :: Feature/MemoryLimit.c
	  # I disable memorylimit check intentionally, WONTFIX for now
    KLEE :: Runtime/POSIX/Isatty.c
	  # After initialziation, we do not want to deal with symbolic branch in POSIX.
	  # So you need to know additonal properties of input file (including stdin),
	  # e.g. size, isatty, etc.
	  # Now we cheat those information as known (we have oracle) when replaying
	  # sqlite and php. Such decision causes this external test no long work.
	  # WONTFIX
    KLEE :: Runtime/POSIX/Stdin.c
	  # The same reason as above (Runtime/POSIX/Isatty.c)
    KLEE :: regression/2017-02-21-pathOS-id.c
	  # I change pathOS recording to use binary format (PathEntry) instead o
	  # text "0" or "1". WONTFIX
